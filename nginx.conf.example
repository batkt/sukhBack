# 413 Request Entity Too Large = NGINX rejecting the body before it reaches Node.
# Fix: set client_max_body_size in the server block (or in location /api).
#
# 20M is required for medegdel/chat image uploads (phone photos can be ~2–20MB).
#
# IMPORTANT for medegdel images (404 on sent images):
# - Do NOT serve /api/medegdel/ as static files. Proxy all /api to Node so the app
#   can serve uploaded files from the same place they are saved.
# - In production, set MEDEGDEL_UPLOAD_ROOT to an absolute path so upload and serve
#   use the same directory even if process.cwd() differs (e.g. when run via systemd/pm2).
#
# Example full server block:
#
# server {
#     listen 80;
#     server_name amarhome.mn;
#     client_max_body_size 20M;   # required for medegdel/chat image uploads (~2–20MB)
#
#     location /api {
#         proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8084;
#         proxy_http_version 1.1;
#         proxy_set_header Host $host;
#         proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
#         client_max_body_size 20M;   # optional: limit only for /api
#     }
# }
#
# After editing: sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
